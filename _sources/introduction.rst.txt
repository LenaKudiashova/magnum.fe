Introduction
============

magnum.fe is a Python library for the solution of micromagnetic problems with the finite-element method. It implements state of the art algorithms and tightly integrates with the powerful finite-element library `FEniCS <http://fenicsproject.org/>`_. Simulation scripts are written in Python which leads to very readable yet flexible code. Due to FEniCS integration extensive postprocessing can be done directly in the simulations scripts. Alternatively results can be written to PVD files and postprocessed with `Paraview <http://www.paraview.org/>`_. This manual is meant to give you both a quick start and a reference to magnum.fe.
