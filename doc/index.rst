Welcome to magnum.fe's documentation!
=====================================

magnum.fe is a finite-element package for the solution of dynamical micromagnetic problems. It is written in Python and C++ and largely relies on the multi purpose finite-element library `FEniCS <http://fenicsproject.org/>`_. For the solution of open-boundary problems a hybrid FEM/BEM method is implemented that uses the `BEM++ <http://www.bempp.org/>`_ library. magnum.fe is free software and can be extended to your needs.

Features
++++++++
* Integration of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equation
* Demagnetization-field computation via shell transformation or hybrid FEM/BEM method
* Oersted-field computation via shell transformation or hybrid FEM/BEM method
* Solution of the spin-diffusion model
